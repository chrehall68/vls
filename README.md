# Verilog Language Server Extension

Inspired by the lack of editor support in existing Verilog extensions for VSCode, this repository contains a powerful, hand-written Verilog language server and an extension to use it with VSCode.

To use the extension, simply open the workspace containing your Verilog project. Assuming the project is opened in Trusted mode, the extension should be able to instantly provide feedback.

## Functionality

Current Features:

- Completions
- Go To Definition for modules
- Token Highlighting
- Warning Diagnostics

Roadmap Features:

- Go To Definition for variables
- Find all References
- Error-tolerant parser
